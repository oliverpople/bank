## Bank

## Project Overview

This project is a simple example tech test.  The purpose of this test is to practise the skills required to successfully pass a tech test (including but not limited to - Using TDD, good documentation and writing clear code).  The challenge for this test is to write a simple banking program with the following requirements

- You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).
